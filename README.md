# Awesome: anti-Shortcut Learning
A curated list of 'anti-shortcut learning', 'combating spurious correlations/features/attributes', and 'debiasing' related papers. In progress.

## Analysis
- [Which shortcut cues will dnns choose? a study from the parameter-space perspective, arXiv 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03095)

## Methods
- [Last Layer Re-Training is Sufficient for Robustness to Spurious Correlations, arXiv 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02937). Just last layer retraining on large ImageNet-trained models can significantly improve robustness. This potentially reduces the issue of spurious correlations to a linear problem.
